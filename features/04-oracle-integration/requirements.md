# Oracle Integration Feature Requirements

## Overview
Feature for integrating with external price oracles to provide reliable BTC/USD price feeds for collateral ratio calculations.

## Functional Requirements

### Price Data Retrieval
**WHERE** Oracle price data is available **THEN** the system SHALL use the latest BTC/USD price with 5-minute freshness guarantee for all ratio calculations.

**WHEN** price data is requested **THEN** the system SHALL fetch from ICP native oracle with timestamp and confidence scoring.

### Price Validation
**WHERE** price data is received **THEN** the system SHALL validate:
- Timestamp is within 5 minutes of current time
- Confidence score is above minimum threshold (80%)
- Price is within reasonable bounds (Â±50% from previous price)

### Price Caching
**WHILE** system operates **THEN** the system SHALL cache price data with 30-second TTL to optimize performance.

**WHEN** cached price expires **THEN** the system SHALL fetch fresh price data from oracle.

### Fallback Mechanisms
**IF** Oracle is unavailable **THEN** the system SHALL use last valid cached price with extended TTL (15 minutes).

**IF** price data is stale or invalid **THEN** the system SHALL halt critical operations (minting, liquidation) and provide clear error messages.

### Price Updates
**WHEN** new price data is received **THEN** the system SHALL:
1. Update all CDP collateral ratio calculations
2. Identify newly liquidatable CDPs
3. Trigger liquidation alerts for affected positions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability
- Oracle integration SHALL have 99.9% uptime
- System SHALL gracefully handle Oracle failures
- Price data SHALL be validated for accuracy before use

### Performance
- Price queries SHALL complete within 50ms
- Cached price retrieval SHALL complete within 10ms
- System SHALL handle 1000 concurrent price lookups

### Accuracy
- Price data SHALL maintain 8 decimal place precision
- System SHALL detect and handle price manipulation attempts
- Confidence scoring SHALL accurately reflect data reliability

## Error Handling
- **OraclePriceError**: When price data is unavailable or stale
- **InvalidPriceData**: When price is outside reasonable bounds
- **OracleConnectionError**: When unable to connect to Oracle
- **PriceManipulationDetected**: When price change exceeds safety thresholds

## Testing Requirements
- Oracle failure scenarios
- Price manipulation detection
- Cache expiration and freshness
- Concurrent price requests
- Edge cases: extreme price volatility, Oracle downtime
- Integration tests with mock Oracle responses
- Performance testing under high load
