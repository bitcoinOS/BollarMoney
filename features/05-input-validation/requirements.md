# Input Validation Feature Requirements

## Overview
Feature for validating all user inputs across the Bollar Money protocol to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid operations.

## Functional Requirements

### BTC Amount Validation
**WHERE** BTC amounts are provided **THEN** the system SHALL validate minimum 0.001 BTC and maximum 1000 BTC limits and reject invalid amounts.

**WHEN** fractional BTC amounts are provided **THEN** the system SHALL accept precision up to 8 decimal places (satoshi level).

**WHERE** zero or negative amounts are provided **THEN** the system SHALL reject with clear error messages.

### BTC Address Validation
**WHERE** BTC addresses are provided **THEN** the system SHALL validate P2PKH, P2SH, or Bech32 address formats before processing deposits.

**WHEN** validating BTC addresses **THEN** the system SHALL:
- Verify address length and character set
- Validate checksum for address integrity
- Reject addresses on testnet when mainnet is expected
- Provide clear error messages for invalid formats

### Principal ID Validation
**WHERE** ICP Principal IDs are provided **THEN** the system SHALL validate proper Principal format and reject malformed IDs.

**WHEN** validating Principal IDs **THEN** the system SHALL ensure the Principal corresponds to an actual ICP identity.

### Numeric Validation
**WHERE** percentages are provided (collateral ratios, penalties) **THEN** the system SHALL validate ranges between 0-100%.

**WHEN** currency amounts are provided **THEN** the system SHALL:
- Accept positive numbers only
- Validate against reasonable bounds
- Handle decimal precision appropriately

### String Validation
**WHERE** text inputs are provided **THEN** the system SHALL:
- Sanitize to prevent injection attacks
- Validate maximum length limits
- Reject null or empty strings where required

### Transaction ID Validation
**WHERE** transaction IDs are provided **THEN** the system SHALL validate proper format for BTC transaction hashes (64-character hex).

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Input validation SHALL complete within 10ms per validation
- System SHALL handle 1000 concurrent validation requests
- Batch validation SHALL process efficiently

### Security
- All inputs SHALL be sanitized before processing
- System SHALL prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks
- Validation SHALL occur before any state changes
- Malformed inputs SHALL not reveal system internals

### User Experience
- Error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
- Validation SHALL provide specific field-level feedback
- System SHALL suggest corrections where possible

## Error Handling
- **InvalidAmount**: When BTC amount is outside valid range
- **InvalidAddress**: When BTC address format is invalid
- **InvalidPrincipal**: When ICP Principal format is invalid
- **InvalidFormat**: When input format doesn't match expected pattern
- **OutOfRange**: When numeric values exceed reasonable bounds
- **EmptyInput**: When required fields are empty

## Validation Rules

### BTC Amount Rules
- Minimum: 0.001 BTC (100,000 satoshis)
- Maximum: 1000 BTC (100,000,000,000 satoshis)
- Precision: 8 decimal places maximum
- Must be positive

### BTC Address Rules
- P2PKH: Starts with "1", 26-35 characters, base58
- P2SH: Starts with "3", 26-35 characters, base58
- Bech32: Starts with "bc1", 42-62 characters, bech32 encoding
- Valid checksum required

### Principal ID Rules
- Valid ICP Principal format
- Must decode to valid Principal structure
- Length between 10-63 bytes

## Testing Requirements
- Boundary testing for all numeric limits
- Invalid format testing for all input types
- Security testing for injection attempts
- Performance testing under load
- User experience testing for error message clarity
- Cross-validation testing between related fields
