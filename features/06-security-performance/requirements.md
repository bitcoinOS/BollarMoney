# Security & Performance Feature Requirements

## Overview
Feature ensuring the Bollar Money protocol meets security standards and performance targets for production deployment.

## Security Requirements

### Access Control
**WHERE** CDPs exist **THEN** only the original owner SHALL be able to view or modify their CDP state.

**WHEN** system configuration changes are attempted **THEN** only authorized admin Principals SHALL be allowed to make changes.

**WHERE** liquidation triggers are processed **THEN** any user SHALL be allowed to liquidate undercollateralized CDPs.

### Data Protection
**WHILE** user data is stored **THEN** the system SHALL prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**WHERE** private keys or authentication data exists **THEN** the system SHALL never expose this information in logs or error messages.

### Reentrancy Protection
**WHEN** state-changing operations are executed **THEN** the system SHALL implement reentrancy protection to prevent recursive calls.

**WHERE** external calls are made **THEN** the system SHALL ensure atomic transaction integrity.

### Input Sanitization
**WHERE** any user input is processed **THEN** the system SHALL sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- The system SHALL process CDP creation queries within 100ms
- The system SHALL process minting and closing updates within 500ms
- Price queries SHALL complete within 50ms
- Liquidation processing SHALL complete within 500ms per CDP

### Throughput
- System SHALL support 100 concurrent CDP operations
- System SHALL handle 1000 concurrent price lookups
- System SHALL process 10 liquidations per second
- System SHALL support 1000 concurrent users

### Resource Usage
**WHILE** system operates **THEN** memory usage SHALL remain below 4GB peak
- System SHALL efficiently use StableBTreeMap for storage
- Price caching SHALL use memory-efficient TTL implementation
- Batch processing SHALL optimize memory allocation

### Scalability
**WHERE** user count increases **THEN** the system SHALL maintain consistent performance characteristics.

## Monitoring Requirements

### System Health
**WHILE** system operates **THEN** the system SHALL monitor:
- Total collateral BTC amount
- Total Bollar minted
- Active CDP count
- Liquidation events
- System utilization ratio

### Performance Metrics
**WHERE** operations occur **THEN** the system SHALL track:
- Average response times per operation type
- Error rates and types
- Memory usage patterns
- Concurrent user counts

### Alerting
**WHEN** performance thresholds are exceeded **THEN** the system SHALL provide appropriate alerts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability
- System SHALL maintain consistent state across all operations using atomic transactions
- System SHALL provide clear error messages for all failure conditions
- System SHALL handle Oracle failures gracefully using cached prices
- System SHALL maintain audit trail of all state changes

### Data Integrity
- All calculations SHALL be mathematically accurate with proper decimal handling
- System SHALL maintain BTC collateral and Bollar minting amounts traceable
- State SHALL remain consistent even during system failures

### Security Monitoring
**WHERE** security events occur **THEN** the system SHALL log and alert on suspicious activities.

## Testing Requirements

### Security Testing
- Penetration testing for all endpoints
- Access control validation
- Input validation testing
- Reentrancy attack prevention testing

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with 1000 concurrent users
- Stress testing with maximum BTC amounts
- Memory usage profiling
- Response time benchmarking

### Monitoring Testing
- Alert system functionality
- Metric collection accuracy
- Performance threshold validation
- System health check verification

## Optimization Strategies

### Caching
- Price data caching with 30-second TTL
- CDP state caching for frequent queries
- Batch liquidation processing
- Memory-efficient data structures (StableBTreeMap)

### Resource Management
- Garbage collection optimization
- Memory pool management
- Connection pooling for external services
- Efficient serialization/deserialization
